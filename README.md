> to be "The Book," a handwritten, collective novel filled with feuding
> royal families, murderous sorcerers, and narrow escapes. Anyone is
> free to write in "The Book," adding their own stories, crossing out
> others, or even appending "footnotes" in the form of little paper
> pouches full of extra text-but of course there are pouches within
> pouches, so that the story is impossible to read "in order," and soon
> begins to overwhelm the narratorâ€™s orderly treatise.
